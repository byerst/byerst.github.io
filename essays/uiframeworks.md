Even though UI frameworks may seem difficult to learn at first, what you obtain from using a framework vastly outweighs the cost. We live in an age where the web is accessed by a wide range of devices from computers to smartphones, so we need our webpages and services to be able to work properly on any device. UI Frameworks like Semantic UI provide developers with an easy way of creating responsive webpages that will be able to be viewed by any type of device. This can be done without a framework, but they definitely make the job much easier on the developer, allowing them to produce results in a faster, more timely manner. A framework like Semantic UI provides web developers with a fast and easy way to create attractive and responsive websites after spending a short amount of time on how to apply the framework.

I personally had a good experience with Semantic UI over the couple of weeks I spent learning it. How you apply the Semantic UI was fairly straightforward to me so I did not run into any particularly strenuous issues early on. There is also a lot of documentation on how to use it, so applying something new from the framework is as simple as looking at examples. I found a big reason Semantic was easy for me to pick up is how intuitive it is. Their class system and Javascript usage is fairly easy to follow and understand how to implement. This makes it really easy to apply to whatever you're working on.
