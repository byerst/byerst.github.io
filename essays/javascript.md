Prior to taking ICS314, I had no experience with the JavaScript programming language. I have however worked with various other languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, and Python which I feel have given me a solid foundation in learning other languages.

I've noticed a lot of similarities between JavaScript and other programming languages like C. I've noticed the syntax for JavaScript is very similar to that of C, an example being the use of a semicolon to denote the end of a statement. These similarities have allowed me to feel comfortable with most of the JavaScript language, and ultimately have made it easy for me to learn.
