IM Near is a mobile application that I helped create with a partner as a project for our EE396 project in the Fall of 2015. IM Near is an app designed to automatically send texts informing your friends that youâ€™ll be arriving shortly. After inputting an address, phone number, and message, IM Near uses GPS services to compare your distance to the destination. Once the user is close enough, the app sends the predetermined message. This project provided me with experience in designing a mobile app using the android development kit.

IM Near is developed using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), the official IDE for android development. Over the course of a few weeks, we created a mobile app that utilizes the phone's SMS messaging services and GPS tracking to automate the delivery of text messages.

In this project I gained experience with android mobile application design and associated technologies, including the  [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) for GPS access and Google Maps integration, Java for programming the functional abilities of the application, and XML for handling the layout and organization of the app.
