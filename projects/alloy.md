Alloy is a tool to help members of the University of Hawaii community make their project ideas become a reality. Alloy provides its users with a method of connecting people to projects by allowing people to post their projects which can be seen by the entire Alloy userbase. Within the web application users can also invite people to their projects, and search for interesting projects they would like to become a part of. To put it simply, Alloy bridges the gap between people who have great project ideas and people who want to work on great projects.
